# Money Simulator

This is just a proof of concept so that I can understand how money flows through societies. Especially, with stocks and stuff.

For example. John Doe puts money in stocks, which goes to Company Foo which pays Jane Doe who puts money back in another company ... etc. Everyone lends money. What happens in the end.
